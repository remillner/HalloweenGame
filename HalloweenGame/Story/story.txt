As darkness falls upon the land, children near and far don their festive creations for this most sacred of Pagan holidays - Hallow’s Eve. Or as you may know it, Halloween. Ghouls and goblins lead your way into the darkest of nights filled with the wretched souls of the departed as they watch the children pass door to door on a quest for conquered sweets. Your mother, so prepared, has dressed you all in feathers. You are a duck, you see, the cutest on the block. You are sure to win many tokens of favor from the locals. 
Barky the puppy bounds up to you all a flutter, wishing to accompany you on this magical journey from home. Mother produces another costume, this one tiny and an egg, and surprises you by dressing Barky in it. He is to travel alongside you, keeping you safe throughout the evening’s festivities. 
You exit the safety of home and embark on your journey with Barky at your side. You see the flood of children weaving through the houses and approach your first stop. 
Door opens an old woman appears and offers you handmade mini pies. You happily reach out to take one, and as you turn to go you feel a sharp pain on the back of your head and suddenly the world goes dark. 
You reach the bottom of the stairs but before you can climb the first step something bites your leg. As you start to fall your hand brushes a string. You pull it, trying to stop your fall but to no avail. You fall hard on the concrete but you have turned on the lights! A wild {0} appears before you. 
You reach the basement door and dare to try the knob. It is already open, as if someone was expecting you…
You take a tentative step out of the doorway and find yourself in a kitchen. It looks a lot like your kitchen at home. The Refrigerator door is open and someone is searching for a treat inside. You try to be silent as you scan for the nearest exit, and spot a doorway just opposite the figure. You make your way slowly, quietly toward it, running your hands along the counter to keep from tripping. You knock a {Objects} off of the counter! 
Weary from your battle you stagger into the next room to find a {0} busy reading a book. As a sound startles you both you know you have been seen. 
You stare down at the dead thing before you, wondering how such a perfect night had gone so awry, when a sad bark snaps you out of your reverie. “Barky?!” You know he must be close so you run toward the sound and find yourself facing stairs. Barky must be upstairs! But what if more strange creatures lie in wait there in the darkness? You take one step, then the next, willing yourself onward. You would find Barky, no matter what!
